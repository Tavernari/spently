              Imagine setting a simple monthly spending goal â€“ say, $1000 for your variable expenses. {APP_NAME} doesn't care how much you earn or what you spend on groceries versus entertainment. Its sole focus is to help you stay within that target.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by the principle that <strong className="text-primary-dark">less is more</strong>, we help you gain daily awareness. Know instantly if you're on track, or if today's spending might compromise your goals for the rest of the month.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't about restrictive budgeting; it's about <strong className="text-primary-dark">conscious spending</strong> and achieving financial peace of mind by controlling your outflow, not meticulously cataloging every cent.
